#   https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/tree/master/styles

# The paths at which cheatsheets are available. Tags associated with a cheatpath
# are automatically attached to all cheatsheets residing on that path.
#
# Whenever cheatsheets share the same title (like 'tar'), the most local
# cheatsheets (those which come later in this file) take precedent over the
# less local sheets. This allows you to create your own "overides" for
# "upstream" cheatsheets.
#
# But what if you want to view the "upstream" cheatsheets instead of your own?
# Cheatsheets may be filtered via 'cheat -t <tag>' in combination with other
# commands. So, if you want to view the 'tar' cheatsheet that is tagged as
# 'community' rather than your own, you can use: cheat tar -t community
